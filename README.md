# git-homework

## Let’s put everything we’ve learned into practice:

1. we’ll start by creating a repo in github called git-homework
2. clone the repo into your local computer
3. add a file called lines.txt
4. add another file called trees.txt
5. add and commit these 2 files with a proper message
6. add 2 tree names, oak and pine for example to the trees.txt file
7. commit and push it
8. go to github and make sure all your changes appear there
9. add 5 more line to each file, committing each one of them separately (10 commits in total), make sure to push every 2-3 commits.
10. 
## Bonus
* delete the lines.txt file commit and push.
* revert the 7th commit, and push it.
* bring back the lines.txt file by finding the commit that deleted the file (use git log) and reverting it.
